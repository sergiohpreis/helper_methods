# Helper Methods

A simple library that contains some methods that I frequently use on the development

The `helper_methods` object is organized as above: 

* `numbers`  
Methods used to handle with numbers
* `parcels`  
Methods used to handle with parcels (*frequently on ecommerces*)


## How to use:

### formatNumber (number)
Type: `number`
   
Transform a number on a formatted number, for example:

```javascript
helper_methods.number.formatNumber(15987.54);
// return 15.987,54
```
